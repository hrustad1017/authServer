# authServer
a simple authentication server written in node js that has some similar functionality with SuperLogin

to use this authServer you must have a CouchDB instance and a Redis instance to connect to either locally or in the cloud.

authServer needs to have better security if anyone is interested in helping with that as well as adding logging and analytics.

I will add further documentation soon.
